Our submission for round 1 of Convolve, a collaborative ML/AI hackathon by 6 IITs, revolves around Log Anomaly Detection in computing. Logging, the meticulous recording of events in a computer system, is the backbone of our approach. It captures problems, errors, and operational details in the operating system or other software through log entries. Log Anomaly Detection becomes our focal point, utilizing Machine Learning to identify anomalies in software-generated logs. 

Anomaly, synonymous with exceptions, represents anything deviating from the usual, especially rare or unexpected events in software engineering. Our task involves training an ML model on the provided data, consisting of logs from software, to predict whether a given log in the testing data is an anomaly or adheres to normal patterns. 

The complete solution, encapsulated in the Python3 notebook "log_detection.ipynb," along with the training and testing datasets ("train.json" and "test.json," respectively), can be explored on the Kaggle page for the contest. The extensive training set, too large for direct inclusion, is available for access on Kaggle, providing a comprehensive resource for enthusiasts and participants.
